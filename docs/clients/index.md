title: Clients
---

Clients are not included in this repository yet but `clients/terminal.js` acts as a simple test interface that connects to the server and enables live input.

Clients would include bots that connect to Slack, Hipchat, Line, Facebook, etc...

Some platforms like Facebook currently only allow webhooks and not connected bots but it's possible to create an client which will handle the webhooks. I may publish some clients that handle webhooks once the code is better.
