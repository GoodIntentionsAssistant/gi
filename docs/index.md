GI is a rule based chatbot framework made in Node.js.

It is very much experimental and in its infancy. We're looking for the community to build, improve and provide feedback on the framework. This documentation is not fully complete so it is only recommended to use this framework if you're prepared to dive into the code.

The framework comes with a collection of examples.

The bot server cannot just be run by itself, it requires clients to act as middleware.

The system has inspirations from Api.ai so some of their documentation found at [https://docs.api.ai/](https://docs.api.ai/) can also be used to get an overview of some aspects of this system.
